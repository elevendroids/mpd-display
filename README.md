## Description

This is a simple MPD (Music Player Daemon) status display application, that is going to show current song info on a LCD text display attached to Raspberry Pi Zero via an I2C bus. Actually, it's going to be deployed on the RPi that is already running as an audio sink (remote audio output) in my bedroom :-)

Work in progress...
